# PhantomGuard

PhantomGuard is a powerful security analysis toolkit that combines advanced rootkit detection, memory forensics, and system monitoring capabilities. Built with Python and Rust, it provides comprehensive protection against sophisticated threats, featuring real-time analysis, container security scanning, and network traffic monitoring.

## Project Status

⚠️ **Notice**: PhantomGuard is currently under active development. APIs may change, and new features are being added regularly.
## Features

- **Advanced Memory Forensics**: Deep analysis of system memory to detect malicious code injection, hidden processes, and runtime anomalies
- **Network Security Monitoring**: Real-time traffic analysis with anomaly detection and suspicious connection identification
- **Rootkit Detection**: Comprehensive scanning for kernel-level and user-mode rootkits with syscall hook detection
- **Container Security**: Analysis of container images and running containers for vulnerabilities and security misconfigurations
- **Vulnerability Management**: System-wide scanning for known vulnerabilities with CVE matching and remediation guidance
- **Real-time System Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring with customizable alerting and automated response capabilities
- **Multi-platform Support**: Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows environments
- **Performance Optimization**: Configurable resource usage with Rust-accelerated components for high-performance environments

## Implementation

The tool is currently implemented in Python with plans for performance-critical components to be implemented in Rust:

- **Python**: High-level orchestration, reporting, and analysis logic
- **Rust**: Performance-critical components (planned)

See [RUST.md](RUST.md) for details on the Rust implementation plans.

## Installation

⚠️ **Note**: PhantomGuard is currently in development and not yet available on PyPI.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/phantomguard.git
cd phantomguard

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install in development mode
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

## Usage

```bash
# Basic system scan
phantomguard scan

# Full security analysis
phantomguard analyze --full

# Container security check
phantomguard container-scan

# Memory analysis
phantomguard memory-scan
```
