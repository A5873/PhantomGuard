# PhantomGuard

PhantomGuard is a powerful security analysis toolkit that combines advanced rootkit detection, memory forensics, and system monitoring capabilities. Built with Python and Rust, it provides comprehensive protection against sophisticated threats, featuring real-time analysis, container security scanning, and network traffic monitoring.

## Project Status

⚠️ **Notice**: PhantomGuard is currently under active development. APIs may change, and new features are being added regularly.
## Features

- Memory forensics and analysis
- Network traffic monitoring
- Rootkit detection
- Container security analysis
- System vulnerability scanning
- Real-time system monitoring

## Implementation

The tool is currently implemented in Python with plans for performance-critical components to be implemented in Rust:

- **Python**: High-level orchestration, reporting, and analysis logic
- **Rust**: Performance-critical components (planned)

See [RUST.md](RUST.md) for details on the Rust implementation plans.

## Installation

```bash
pip install phantomguard
```

## Usage
